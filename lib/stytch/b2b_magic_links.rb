    # Authenticate a Member with a Magic Link. This endpoint requires a Magic Link token that is not expired or previously used. If the Member’s status is `pending` or `invited`, they will be updated to `active`.
    # Provide the `session_duration_minutes` parameter to set the lifetime of the session. If the `session_duration_minutes` parameter is not specified, a Stytch session will be created with a 60 minute duration.
    # 
    # If the Member is required to complete MFA to log in to the Organization, the returned value of `member_authenticated` will be `false`, and an `intermediate_session_token` will be returned.
    # The `intermediate_session_token` can be passed into the [OTP SMS Authenticate endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-otp-sms), [TOTP Authenticate endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-totp), 
    # or [Recovery Codes Recover endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/recovery-codes-recover) to complete the MFA step and acquire a full member session.
    # The `intermediate_session_token` can also be used with the [Exchange Intermediate Session endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/exchange-intermediate-session) or the [Create Organization via Discovery endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/create-organization-via-discovery) to join a different Organization or create a new one.
    # The `session_duration_minutes` and `session_custom_claims` parameters will be ignored.
    # 
    # If a valid `session_token` or `session_jwt` is passed in, the Member will not be required to complete an MFA step.
    # 
    # == Parameters:
    # magic_links_token::
    #   The Email Magic Link token to authenticate.
    #   The type of this field is +String+.
    # pkce_code_verifier::
    #   A base64url encoded one time secret used to validate that the request starts and ends on the same device.
    #   The type of this field is nilable +String+.
    # session_token::
    #   Reuse an existing session instead of creating a new one. If you provide a `session_token`, Stytch will update the session.
    #       If the `session_token` and `magic_links_token` belong to different Members, the `session_token` will be ignored. This endpoint will error if
    #       both `session_token` and `session_jwt` are provided.
    #   The type of this field is nilable +String+.
    # session_jwt::
    #   Reuse an existing session instead of creating a new one. If you provide a `session_jwt`, Stytch will update the session. If the `session_jwt`
    #       and `magic_links_token` belong to different Members, the `session_jwt` will be ignored. This endpoint will error if both `session_token` and `session_jwt`
    #       are provided.
    #   The type of this field is nilable +String+.
    # session_duration_minutes::
    #   Set the session lifetime to be this many minutes from now. This will start a new session if one doesn't already exist, 
    #   returning both an opaque `session_token` and `session_jwt` for this session. Remember that the `session_jwt` will have a fixed lifetime of
    #   five minutes regardless of the underlying session duration, and will need to be refreshed over time.
    # 
    #   This value must be a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 527040 minutes (366 days).
    #   
    #   If a `session_token` or `session_jwt` is provided then a successful authentication will continue to extend the session this many minutes.
    #   
    #   If the `session_duration_minutes` parameter is not specified, a Stytch session will be created with a 60 minute duration. If you don't want
    #   to use the Stytch session product, you can ignore the session fields in the response.
    #   The type of this field is nilable +Integer+.
    # session_custom_claims::
    #   Add a custom claims map to the Session being authenticated. Claims are only created if a Session is initialized by providing a value in
    #   `session_duration_minutes`. Claims will be included on the Session object and in the JWT. To update a key in an existing Session, supply a new value. To
    #   delete a key, supply a null value. Custom claims made with reserved claims (`iss`, `sub`, `aud`, `exp`, `nbf`, `iat`, `jti`) will be ignored.
    #   Total custom claims size cannot exceed four kilobytes.
    #   The type of this field is nilable +object+.
    # locale::
    #   If the Member needs to complete an MFA step, and the Member has a phone number, this endpoint will pre-emptively send a one-time passcode (OTP) to the Member's phone number. The locale argument will be used to determine which language to use when sending the passcode.
    # 
    # Parameter is a [IETF BCP 47 language tag](https://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/), e.g. `"en"`.
    # 
    # Currently supported languages are English (`"en"`), Spanish (`"es"`), and Brazilian Portuguese (`"pt-br"`); if no value is provided, the copy defaults to English.
    # 
    # Request support for additional languages [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScZSpAu_m2AmLXRT3F3kap-s_mcV6UTBitYn6CdyWP0-o7YjQ/viewform?usp=sf_link")!
    # 
    #   The type of this field is nilable +AuthenticateRequestLocale+ (string enum).
    # intermediate_session_token::
    #   Adds this primary authentication factor to the intermediate session token. If the resulting set of factors satisfies the organization's primary authentication requirements and MFA requirements, the intermediate session token will be consumed and converted to a member session. If not, the same intermediate session token will be returned.
    #   The type of this field is nilable +String+.
    # 
    # == Returns:
    # An object with the following fields:
    # request_id::
    #   Globally unique UUID that is returned with every API call. This value is important to log for debugging purposes; we may ask for this value to help identify a specific API call when helping you debug an issue.
    #   The type of this field is +String+.
    # member_id::
    #   Globally unique UUID that identifies a specific Member.
    #   The type of this field is +String+.

    #     Stytch's Session product. If you are using Stytch's Session product, we revoke the Member’s other Sessions for you.
    #   The type of this field is +Boolean+.
    # organization_id::
    #   Globally unique UUID that identifies a specific Organization. The `organization_id` is critical to perform operations on an Organization, so be sure to preserve this value.
    #   The type of this field is +String+.
    # member::
    #   The [Member object](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/member-object)
    #   The type of this field is +Member+ (+object+).

    #   The [Organization object](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/organization-object).
    #   The type of this field is +Organization+ (+object+).
    # intermediate_session_token::
    #   The returned Intermediate Session Token contains an Email Magic Link factor associated with the Member's email address. If this value is non-empty, the member must complete an MFA step to finish logging in to the Organization. The token can be used with the [OTP SMS Authenticate endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-otp-sms), [TOTP Authenticate endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-totp), or [Recovery Codes Recover endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/recovery-codes-recover) to complete an MFA flow and log in to the Organization. It can also be used with the [Exchange Intermediate Session endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/exchange-intermediate-session) to join a specific Organization that allows the factors represented by the intermediate session token; or the [Create Organization via Discovery endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/create-organization-via-discovery) to create a new Organization and Member.
    #   The type of this field is +String+.
    # member_authenticated::
    #   Indicates whether the Member is fully authenticated. If false, the Member needs to complete an MFA step to log in to the Organization.
    #   The type of this field is +Boolean+.
    # status_code::
    #   The HTTP status code of the response. Stytch follows standard HTTP response status code patterns, e.g. 2XX values equate to success, 3XX values are redirects, 4XX are client errors, and 5XX are server errors.

      # Authenticates the Discovery Magic Link token and exchanges it for an Intermediate Session Token. Intermediate Session Tokens can be used for various Discovery login flows and are valid for 10 minutes.
      # 
      # == Parameters:
      # discovery_magic_links_token::
      #   The Discovery Email Magic Link token to authenticate.
      #   The type of this field is +String+.
      # pkce_code_verifier::
      #   A base64url encoded one time secret used to validate that the request starts and ends on the same device.

      # == Returns:
      # An object with the following fields:
      # request_id::
      #   Globally unique UUID that is returned with every API call. This value is important to log for debugging purposes; we may ask for this value to help identify a specific API call when helping you debug an issue.
      #   The type of this field is +String+.
      # intermediate_session_token::
      #   The Intermediate Session Token. This token does not necessarily belong to a specific instance of a Member, but represents a bag of factors that may be converted to a member session. The token can be used with the [OTP SMS Authenticate endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-otp-sms), [TOTP Authenticate endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-totp), or [Recovery Codes Recover endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/recovery-codes-recover) to complete an MFA flow and log in to the Organization. It can also be used with the [Exchange Intermediate Session endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/exchange-intermediate-session) to join a specific Organization that allows the factors represented by the intermediate session token; or the [Create Organization via Discovery endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/create-organization-via-discovery) to create a new Organization and Member.
      #   The type of this field is +String+.
      # email_address::
      #   The email address.
      #   The type of this field is +String+.
      # discovered_organizations::
      #   An array of `discovered_organization` objects tied to the `intermediate_session_token`, `session_token`, or `session_jwt`. See the [Discovered Organization Object](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/discovered-organization-object) for complete details.
      #       
      #   Note that Organizations will only appear here under any of the following conditions:
      #   1. The end user is already a Member of the Organization.
      #   2. The end user is invited to the Organization. 
      #   3. The end user can join the Organization because: 
      #   
      #       a) The Organization allows JIT provisioning.
      #       
      #       b) The Organizations' allowed domains list contains the Member's email domain.
      #       
      #       c) The Organization has at least one other Member with a verified email address with the same domain as the end user (to prevent phishing attacks).
      #   The type of this field is list of +DiscoveredOrganization+ (+object+).
      # status_code::
      #   The HTTP status code of the response. Stytch follows standard HTTP response status code patterns, e.g. 2XX values equate to success, 3XX values are redirects, 4XX are client errors, and 5XX are server errors.
      #   The type of this field is +Integer+.
