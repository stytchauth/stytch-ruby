    # Add a User to Stytch. A `user_id` is returned in the response that can then be used to perform other operations within Stytch. An `email` or a `phone_number` is required.
    #
    # == Parameters:
    # email::
    #   The email address of the end user.
    #   The type of this field is nilable `String`.
    # name::
    #   The name of the user. Each field in the name object is optional.
    #   The type of this field is nilable `Name`.
    # attributes::
    #   Provided attributes help with fraud detection.
    #   The type of this field is nilable `Attributes`.
    # phone_number::
    #   The phone number to use for one-time passcodes. The phone number should be in E.164 format. The phone number should be in E.164 format (i.e. +1XXXXXXXXXX). You may use +10000000000 to test this endpoint, see [Testing](https://stytch.com/docs/home#resources_testing) for more detail.
    #   The type of this field is nilable `String`.
    # create_user_as_pending::
    #   Flag for whether or not to save a user as pending vs active in Stytch. Defaults to false.
    #         If true, users will be saved with status pending in Stytch's backend until authenticated.
    #         If false, users will be created as active. An example usage of
    #         a true flag would be to require users to verify their phone by entering the OTP code before creating
    #         an account for them.
    #   The type of this field is nilable `Boolean`.
    # trusted_metadata::
    #   The `trusted_metadata` field contains an arbitrary JSON object of application-specific data. See the [Metadata](https://stytch.com/docs/api/metadata) reference for complete field behavior details.

    #
    # == Returns:
    # An object with the following fields:
    # request_id::

    # Search for Users within your Stytch Project. Submit an empty `query` in the request to return all Users.
    #
    # == Parameters:
    # cursor::
    #   The `cursor` field allows you to paginate through your results. Each result array is limited to 1000 results. If your query returns more than 1000 results, you will need to paginate the responses using the `cursor`. If you receive a response that includes a non-null `next_cursor` in the `results_metadata` object, repeat the search call with the `next_cursor` value set to the `cursor` field to retrieve the next page of results. Continue to make search calls until the `next_cursor` in the response is null.
    #   The type of this field is nilable `String`.
    # limit::
    #   The number of search results to return per page. The default limit is 100. A maximum of 1000 results can be returned by a single search request. If the total size of your result set is greater than one page size, you must paginate the response. See the `cursor` field.
    #   The type of this field is nilable `Integer`.
    # query::
    #   The optional query object contains the operator, i.e. `AND` or `OR`, and the operands that will filter your results. Only an operator is required. If you include no operands, no filtering will be applied. If you include no query object, it will return all results with no filtering applied.
    #   The type of this field is nilable `SearchUsersQuery`.
    #
    # == Returns:
    # An object with the following fields:
    # request_id::
    #   Globally unique UUID that is returned with every API call. This value is important to log for debugging purposes; we may ask for this value to help identify a specific API call when helping you debug an issue.
    #   The type of this field is `String`.

    #   An array of results that match your search query.
    #   The type of this field is list of `User`.

    # Update a User's attributes.
    #
    # **Note:** In order to add a new email address or phone number to an existing User object, pass the new email address or phone number into the respective `/send` endpoint for the authentication method of your choice. If you specify the existing User's `user_id` while calling the `/send` endpoint, the new email address or phone number will be added to the existing User object upon successful authentication.
