    # Authenticate a user given a token. 
    # This endpoint verifies that the user completed the SSO Authentication flow by verifying that the token is valid and hasn't expired.
    # Provide the `session_duration_minutes` parameter to set the lifetime of the session. 
    # If the `session_duration_minutes` parameter is not specified, a Stytch session will be created with a 60 minute duration.
    # To link this authentication event to an existing Stytch session, include either the `session_token` or `session_jwt` param.
    # 
    # If the Member is required to complete MFA to log in to the Organization, the returned value of `member_authenticated` will be `false`, and an `intermediate_session_token` will be returned.
    # The `intermediate_session_token` can be passed into the [OTP SMS Authenticate endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-otp-sms) to complete the MFA step and acquire a full member session.
    # The `session_duration_minutes` and `session_custom_claims` parameters will be ignored.
    # 
    # If a valid `session_token` or `session_jwt` is passed in, the Member will not be required to complete an MFA step.
    # 
    # == Parameters:
    # sso_token::
    #   The token to authenticate.
    #   The type of this field is +String+.
    # pkce_code_verifier::
    #   A base64url encoded one time secret used to validate that the request starts and ends on the same device.
    #   The type of this field is nilable +String+.
    # session_token::
    #   The `session_token` belonging to the member that you wish to associate the email with.
    #   The type of this field is nilable +String+.
    # session_jwt::
    #   The `session_jwt` belonging to the member that you wish to associate the email with.
    #   The type of this field is nilable +String+.
    # session_duration_minutes::
    #   Set the session lifetime to be this many minutes from now. This will start a new session if one doesn't already exist, 
    #   returning both an opaque `session_token` and `session_jwt` for this session. Remember that the `session_jwt` will have a fixed lifetime of
    #   five minutes regardless of the underlying session duration, and will need to be refreshed over time.
    # 
    #   This value must be a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 527040 minutes (366 days).
    #   
    #   If a `session_token` or `session_jwt` is provided then a successful authentication will continue to extend the session this many minutes.
    #   
    #   If the `session_duration_minutes` parameter is not specified, a Stytch session will be created with a 60 minute duration. If you don't want
    #   to use the Stytch session product, you can ignore the session fields in the response.
    #   The type of this field is nilable +Integer+.
    # session_custom_claims::
    #   Add a custom claims map to the Session being authenticated. Claims are only created if a Session is initialized by providing a value in
    #   `session_duration_minutes`. Claims will be included on the Session object and in the JWT. To update a key in an existing Session, supply a new value. To
    #   delete a key, supply a null value. Custom claims made with reserved claims (`iss`, `sub`, `aud`, `exp`, `nbf`, `iat`, `jti`) will be ignored.
    #   Total custom claims size cannot exceed four kilobytes.
    #   The type of this field is nilable +object+.
    # locale::
    #   If the Member needs to complete an MFA step, and the Member has a phone number, this endpoint will pre-emptively send a one-time passcode (OTP) to the Member's phone number. The locale argument will be used to determine which language to use when sending the passcode.
    # 
    # Parameter is a [IETF BCP 47 language tag](https://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/), e.g. `"en"`.
    # 
    # Currently supported languages are English (`"en"`), Spanish (`"es"`), and Brazilian Portuguese (`"pt-br"`); if no value is provided, the copy defaults to English.
    # 
    # Request support for additional languages [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScZSpAu_m2AmLXRT3F3kap-s_mcV6UTBitYn6CdyWP0-o7YjQ/viewform?usp=sf_link")!

    #   Globally unique UUID that identifies a specific Member.
    #   The type of this field is +String+.

    # reset_session::
    #   Indicates if all Sessions linked to the Member need to be reset. You should check this field if you aren't using
    #     Stytch's Session product. If you are using Stytch's Session product, we revoke the Member’s other Sessions for you.

    #       SSO factors are not transferable between Organizations, so the intermediate session token is not valid for use with discovery endpoints.
    #   The type of this field is +String+.
    # member_authenticated::

      # Updates an existing OIDC connection.
      # 
      # When the value of `issuer` changes, Stytch will attempt to retrieve the [OpenID Provider Metadata](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderMetadata) document found at `$/.well-known/openid-configuration`.
      # If the metadata document can be retrieved successfully, Stytch will use it to infer the values of `authorization_url`, `token_url`, `jwks_url`, and `userinfo_url`.
      # The `client_id` and `client_secret` values cannot be inferred from the metadata document, and *must* be passed in explicitly.
      # 
      # If the metadata document cannot be retrieved, Stytch will still update the connection using values from the request body.

      # Used to update an existing SAML connection using an IDP metadata URL.
      # 
      # A newly created connection will not become active until all the following are provided:
      # * `idp_sso_url`
      # * `idp_entity_id`
      # * `x509_certificate`
      # * `attribute_mapping` (must be supplied using [Update SAML Connection](update-saml-connection))
      # 
      # == Parameters:
      # organization_id::
      #   Globally unique UUID that identifies a specific Organization. The `organization_id` is critical to perform operations on an Organization, so be sure to preserve this value.
      #   The type of this field is +String+.
      # connection_id::
      #   Globally unique UUID that identifies a specific SSO `connection_id` for a Member.
      #   The type of this field is +String+.
      # metadata_url::
      #   A URL that points to the IdP metadata. This will be provided by the IdP.
      #   The type of this field is +String+.
      # 
      # == Returns:
      # An object with the following fields:
      # request_id::
      #   Globally unique UUID that is returned with every API call. This value is important to log for debugging purposes; we may ask for this value to help identify a specific API call when helping you debug an issue.
      #   The type of this field is +String+.
      # status_code::
      #   The HTTP status code of the response. Stytch follows standard HTTP response status code patterns, e.g. 2XX values equate to success, 3XX values are redirects, 4XX are client errors, and 5XX are server errors.
      #   The type of this field is +Integer+.
      # connection::
      #   The `SAML Connection` object affected by this API call. See the [SAML Connection Object](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/saml-connection-object) for complete response field details.
      #   The type of this field is nilable +SAMLConnection+ (+object+).

      # Delete a SAML verification certificate.
      # 
      # You may need to do this when rotating certificates from your IdP, since Stytch allows a maximum of 5 certificates per connection. There must always be at least one certificate per active connection.
      # 
      # == Parameters:
      # organization_id::
      #   The organization ID that the SAML connection belongs to.

      #   The ID of the SAML connection.
      #   The type of this field is +String+.
      # certificate_id::
      #   The ID of the certificate to be deleted.
      #   The type of this field is +String+.

      # == Returns:
      # An object with the following fields:
      # request_id::
      #   Globally unique UUID that is returned with every API call. This value is important to log for debugging purposes; we may ask for this value to help identify a specific API call when helping you debug an issue.
      #   The type of this field is +String+.
      # certificate_id::
      #   The ID of the certificate that was deleted.
      #   The type of this field is +String+.
      # status_code::
