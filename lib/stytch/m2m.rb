      #   Globally unique UUID that is returned with every API call. This value is important to log for debugging purposes; we may ask for this value to help identify a specific API call when helping you debug an issue.
      #   The type of this field is +String+.
      # status_code::
      #   The HTTP status code of the response. Stytch follows standard HTTP response status code patterns, e.g. 2XX values equate to success, 3XX values are redirects, 4XX are client errors, and 5XX are server errors.
      #   The type of this field is +Integer+.

      # Search for M2M Clients within your Stytch Project. Submit an empty `query` in the request to return all M2M Clients.
      #
      # The following search filters are supported today:
      # - `client_id`: Pass in a list of client IDs to get many clients in a single request
      # - `client_name`: Search for clients by exact match on client name
      # - `scopes`: Search for clients assigned a specific scope
      #
      # == Parameters:
      # cursor::
      #   The `cursor` field allows you to paginate through your results. Each result array is limited to 1000 results. If your query returns more than 1000 results, you will need to paginate the responses using the `cursor`. If you receive a response that includes a non-null `next_cursor` in the `results_metadata` object, repeat the search call with the `next_cursor` value set to the `cursor` field to retrieve the next page of results. Continue to make search calls until the `next_cursor` in the response is null.
      #   The type of this field is nilable +String+.
      # limit::
      #   The number of search results to return per page. The default limit is 100. A maximum of 1000 results can be returned by a single search request. If the total size of your result set is greater than one page size, you must paginate the response. See the `cursor` field.
      #   The type of this field is nilable +Integer+.
      # query::
      #   The optional query object contains the operator, i.e. `AND` or `OR`, and the operands that will filter your results. Only an operator is required. If you include no operands, no filtering will be applied. If you include no query object, it will return all results with no filtering applied.
      #   The type of this field is nilable +M2MSearchQuery+ (+object+).

      # m2m_clients::
      #   An array of M2M Clients that match your search query.
      #   The type of this field is list of +M2MClient+ (+object+).
      # results_metadata::
      #   The search `results_metadata` object contains metadata relevant to your specific query like total and `next_cursor`.
      #   The type of this field is +ResultsMetadata+ (+object+).
      # status_code::
      #   The HTTP status code of the response. Stytch follows standard HTTP response status code patterns, e.g. 2XX values equate to success, 3XX values are redirects, 4XX are client errors, and 5XX are server errors.
