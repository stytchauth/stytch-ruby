      # Initiates a request for authorization of a Connected App to access a Member's account.
      #
      # Call this endpoint using the query parameters from an OAuth Authorization request.
      # This endpoint validates various fields (`scope`, `client_id`, `redirect_uri`, `prompt`, etc...) are correct and returns
      # relevant information for rendering an OAuth Consent Screen.
      #
      # This endpoint returns:
      # - A public representation of the Connected App requesting authorization
      # - Whether _explicit_ consent must be granted before proceeding with the authorization
      # - A list of scopes the Member has the ability to grant the Connected App
      #
      # Use this response to prompt the Member for consent (if necessary) before calling the [Submit OAuth Authorization](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/connected-apps-oauth-authorize) endpoint.
      #
      # Exactly one of the following must be provided to identify the Member granting authorization:
      # - `organization_id` + `member_id`
      # - `session_token`
      # - `session_jwt`
      #
      # If a `session_token` or `session_jwt` is passed, the OAuth Authorization will be linked to the Member's session for tracking purposes.
      # One of these fields must be used if the Connected App intends to complete the [Exchange Access Token](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/connected-app-access-token-exchange) flow.

      #   An array of scopes requested by the client.
      #   The type of this field is list of +String+.
      # organization_id::
      #   Globally unique UUID that identifies a specific Organization. The `organization_id` is critical to perform operations on an Organization, so be sure to preserve this value. You may also use the organization_slug or organization_external_id here as a convenience.
      #   The type of this field is nilable +String+.
      # member_id::
      #   Globally unique UUID that identifies a specific Member. The `member_id` is critical to perform operations on a Member, so be sure to preserve this value. You may use an external_id here if one is set for the member.
      #   The type of this field is nilable +String+.

      # == Returns:
      # An object with the following fields:
      # request_id::
      #   Globally unique UUID that is returned with every API call. This value is important to log for debugging purposes; we may ask for this value to help identify a specific API call when helping you debug an issue.
