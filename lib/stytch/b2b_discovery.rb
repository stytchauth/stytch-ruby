      # Exchange an Intermediate Session for a fully realized [Member Session](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/session-object) for the [Organization](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/organization-object) that the user wishes to log into.
      #
      # This endpoint can be used to accept invites and JIT Provision into a new Organization on the basis of the user's email domain or OAuth tenant.
      #
      # If the user **has** already satisfied the authentication requirements of the Organization they are trying to exchange into and logged in with a method that verifies their email address, this API will return `member_authenticated: true` and a `session_token` and `session_jwt`.
      #
      # If the user **has not** satisfied the primary or secondary authentication requirements of the Organization they are attempting to exchange into or is JIT Provisioning but did not log in via a method that provides email verification, this API will return `member_authenticated: false` and an `intermediate_session_token`.
      #
      # If `primary_required` is returned, prompt the user to fulfill the Organization's auth requirements using the options returned in `primary_required.allowed_auth_methods`.
      #
      # If `primary_required` is null and `mfa_required` is set, check `mfa_required.member_options` to determine if the Member has SMS OTP or TOTP set up for MFA and prompt accordingly. If the Member has SMS OTP, check `mfa_required.secondary_auth_initiated` to see if the OTP has already been sent.
      #
      # Include the `intermediate_session_token` returned above when calling the `authenticate()` method that the user needed to perform. Once the user has completed the authentication requirements they were missing, they will be granted a full `session_token` and `session_jwt` to indicate they have successfully logged into the Organization.
      #
      # The `intermediate_session_token` can also be used with the [Create Organization via Discovery endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/create-organization-via-discovery) to create a new Organization instead of joining an existing one.
      #
      # == Parameters:
      # intermediate_session_token::
      #   The Intermediate Session Token. This token does not necessarily belong to a specific instance of a Member, but represents a bag of factors that may be converted to a member session. The token can be used with the [OTP SMS Authenticate endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-otp-sms), [TOTP Authenticate endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-totp), or [Recovery Codes Recover endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/recovery-codes-recover) to complete an MFA flow and log in to the Organization. The token has a default expiry of 10 minutes. It can also be used with the [Exchange Intermediate Session endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/exchange-intermediate-session) to join a specific Organization that allows the factors represented by the intermediate session token; or the [Create Organization via Discovery endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/create-organization-via-discovery) to create a new Organization and Member. Intermediate Session Tokens have a default expiry of 10 minutes.
      #   The type of this field is +String+.
      # organization_id::
      #   Globally unique UUID that identifies a specific Organization. The `organization_id` is critical to perform operations on an Organization, so be sure to preserve this value. You may also use the organization_slug here as a convenience.
      #   The type of this field is +String+.
      # session_duration_minutes::
      #   Set the session lifetime to be this many minutes from now. This will start a new session if one doesn't already exist,
      #   returning both an opaque `session_token` and `session_jwt` for this session. Remember that the `session_jwt` will have a fixed lifetime of
      #   five minutes regardless of the underlying session duration, and will need to be refreshed over time.
      #
      #   This value must be a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 527040 minutes (366 days).
      #
      #   If a `session_token` or `session_jwt` is provided then a successful authentication will continue to extend the session this many minutes.
      #
      #   If the `session_duration_minutes` parameter is not specified, a Stytch session will be created with a 60 minute duration. If you don't want
      #   to use the Stytch session product, you can ignore the session fields in the response.
      #   The type of this field is nilable +Integer+.
      # session_custom_claims::
      #   Add a custom claims map to the Session being authenticated. Claims are only created if a Session is initialized by providing a value in
      #   `session_duration_minutes`. Claims will be included on the Session object and in the JWT. To update a key in an existing Session, supply a new value. To
      #   delete a key, supply a null value. Custom claims made with reserved claims (`iss`, `sub`, `aud`, `exp`, `nbf`, `iat`, `jti`) will be ignored.
      #   Total custom claims size cannot exceed four kilobytes.
      #   The type of this field is nilable +object+.
      # locale::
      #   If the Member needs to complete an MFA step, and the Member has a phone number, this endpoint will pre-emptively send a one-time passcode (OTP) to the Member's phone number. The locale argument will be used to determine which language to use when sending the passcode.
      #
      # Parameter is a [IETF BCP 47 language tag](https://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/), e.g. `"en"`.
      #
      # Currently supported languages are English (`"en"`), Spanish (`"es"`), and Brazilian Portuguese (`"pt-br"`); if no value is provided, the copy defaults to English.
      #
      # Request support for additional languages [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScZSpAu_m2AmLXRT3F3kap-s_mcV6UTBitYn6CdyWP0-o7YjQ/viewform?usp=sf_link")!

      # This endpoint allows you to exchange the `intermediate_session_token` returned when the user successfully completes a Discovery authentication flow to create a new
      # [Organization](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/organization-object) and [Member](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/member-object) and log the user in.

      #
      # Stytch **requires that users verify their email address** prior to creating a new Organization in order to prevent Account Takeover (ATO) attacks and phishing.
      #
      # If the user authenticated using a method that **does not** provide real-time email verification (returning password auth, Github/Slack/Hubspot OAuth) this API will return `member_authenticated: false` and an `intermediate_session_token` to indicate that the user must perform additional authentication via one of the options listed in `primary_required.allowed_auth_methods` to finish logging in.
      #
      # If you specified an `mfa_policy: REQUIRED_FOR_ALL` in the request, this API will return `member_authenticated: false`, an `intermediate_session_token`, and `mfa_required` in order to indicate that you must prompt the user to enroll in MFA.
      #
      # Include the `intermediate_session_token` when calling the `authenticate()` method that the user needed to perform to verify their email or enroll in MFA. Once the user has completed the authentication requirements they were missing, they will be granted a full `session_token` and `session_jwt` and be successfully logged in.
      #
      # If the user logged in with a method that **does** provide real-time email verification (Email Magic Links, Email OTP, Google/Microsoft OAuth, initial email verification when creating a new password) this API will return `member_authenticated: true` and a `session_jwt` and `session_token` to indicate that the user has successfully logged in.

      #   The type of this field is +Boolean+.
      # intermediate_session_token::
      #   The returned Intermediate Session Token is identical to the one that was originally passed in to the request. If this value is non-empty, the member must complete an MFA step to finish logging in to the Organization. The token can be used with the [OTP SMS Authenticate endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-otp-sms), [TOTP Authenticate endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-totp), or [Recovery Codes Recover endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/recovery-codes-recover) to complete an MFA flow and log in to the Organization. The token has a default expiry of 10 minutes. It can also be used with the [Exchange Intermediate Session endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/exchange-intermediate-session) to join a specific Organization that allows the factors represented by the intermediate session token; or the [Create Organization via Discovery endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/create-organization-via-discovery) to create a new Organization and Member. Intermediate Session Tokens have a default expiry of 10 minutes.

      # List all possible organization relationships connected to a [Member Session](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/session-object) or Intermediate Session.
      #
      # When a Member Session is passed in, relationships with a type of `active_member`, `pending_member`, or `invited_member`
      # will be returned, and any membership can be assumed by calling the [Exchange Session](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/exchange-session) endpoint.
      #
      # When an Intermediate Session is passed in, all relationship types - `active_member`, `pending_member`, `invited_member`,
      # `eligible_to_join_by_email_domain`, and `eligible_to_join_by_oauth_tenant` - will be returned,
      # and any membership can be assumed by calling the [Exchange Intermediate Session](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/exchange-intermediate-session) endpoint.
      #
      # This endpoint requires either an `intermediate_session_token`, `session_jwt` or `session_token` be included in the request.
      # It will return an error if multiple are present.
      #
      # This operation does not consume the Intermediate Session or Session Token passed in.
      #
      # == Parameters:
      # intermediate_session_token::
      #   The Intermediate Session Token. This token does not necessarily belong to a specific instance of a Member, but represents a bag of factors that may be converted to a member session. The token can be used with the [OTP SMS Authenticate endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-otp-sms), [TOTP Authenticate endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-totp), or [Recovery Codes Recover endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/recovery-codes-recover) to complete an MFA flow and log in to the Organization. The token has a default expiry of 10 minutes. It can also be used with the [Exchange Intermediate Session endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/exchange-intermediate-session) to join a specific Organization that allows the factors represented by the intermediate session token; or the [Create Organization via Discovery endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/create-organization-via-discovery) to create a new Organization and Member. Intermediate Session Tokens have a default expiry of 10 minutes.
      #   The type of this field is nilable +String+.
      # session_token::
      #   A secret token for a given Stytch Session.
      #   The type of this field is nilable +String+.
      # session_jwt::
      #   The JSON Web Token (JWT) for a given Stytch Session.
      #   The type of this field is nilable +String+.
      #
      # == Returns:
      # An object with the following fields:
      # request_id::
      #   Globally unique UUID that is returned with every API call. This value is important to log for debugging purposes; we may ask for this value to help identify a specific API call when helping you debug an issue.
      #   The type of this field is +String+.
      # email_address::
      #   The email address.
      #   The type of this field is +String+.
      # discovered_organizations::
      #   An array of `discovered_organization` objects tied to the `intermediate_session_token`, `session_token`, or `session_jwt`. See the [Discovered Organization Object](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/discovered-organization-object) for complete details.
      #
      #   Note that Organizations will only appear here under any of the following conditions:
      #   1. The end user is already a Member of the Organization.
      #   2. The end user is invited to the Organization.
      #   3. The end user can join the Organization because:
      #
      #       a) The Organization allows JIT provisioning.
      #
      #       b) The Organizations' allowed domains list contains the Member's email domain.
      #
      #       c) The Organization has at least one other Member with a verified email address with the same domain as the end user (to prevent phishing attacks).
      #   The type of this field is list of +DiscoveredOrganization+ (+object+).
      # status_code::
      #   The HTTP status code of the response. Stytch follows standard HTTP response status code patterns, e.g. 2XX values equate to success, 3XX values are redirects, 4XX are client errors, and 5XX are server errors.
      #   The type of this field is +Integer+.
      # organization_id_hint::
      #   If the intermediate session token is associated with a specific Organization, that Organization ID will be returned here. The Organization ID will be null if the intermediate session token was generated by a email magic link discovery or OAuth discovery flow. If a session token or session JWT is provided, the Organization ID hint will be null.
