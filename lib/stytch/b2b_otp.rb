      # Send a One-Time Passcode (OTP) to a Member's phone number.
      # 
      # If the Member already has a phone number, the `mfa_phone_number` field is not needed; the endpoint will send an OTP to the number associated with the Member.
      # If the Member does not have a phone number, the endpoint will send an OTP to the `mfa_phone_number` provided and link the `mfa_phone_number` with the Member.
      # 
      # An error will be thrown if the Member already has a phone number and the provided `mfa_phone_number` does not match the existing one.
      # 
      # Note that sending another OTP code before the first has expired will invalidate the first code.
      # 
      # If a Member has a phone number and is enrolled in MFA, then after a successful primary authentication event (e.g. [email magic link](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-magic-link) or [SSO](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/sso-authenticate) login is complete), an SMS OTP will automatically be sent to their phone number. In that case, this endpoint should only be used for subsequent authentication events, such as prompting a Member for an OTP again after a period of inactivity.

      # SMS OTPs may not be used as a primary authentication mechanism. They can be used to complete an MFA requirement, or they can be used as a step-up factor to be added to an existing session.
      # 
      # This endpoint verifies that the one-time passcode (OTP) is valid and hasn't expired or been previously used. A given Member may only have a single active OTP code at any given time. If a Member requests another OTP code before the first one has expired, the first one will be invalidated.
      # 
      # Exactly one of `intermediate_session_token`, `session_token`, or `session_jwt` must be provided in the request.
      # If an intermediate session token is provided, this operation will consume it.
      # 
      # Intermediate session tokens are generated upon successful calls to primary authenticate methods in the case where MFA is required,
      # such as [email magic link authenticate](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-magic-link),
      # or upon successful calls to discovery authenticate methods, such as [email magic link discovery authenticate](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-discovery-magic-link).
      # 
      # If the Organization's MFA policy is `REQUIRED_FOR_ALL`, a successful OTP authentication will change the Member's `mfa_enrolled` status to `true` if it is not already `true`.
      # If the Organization's MFA policy is `OPTIONAL`, the Member's MFA enrollment can be toggled by passing in a value for the `set_mfa_enrollment` field.
      # The Member's MFA enrollment can also be toggled through the [Update Member](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/update-member) endpoint.
      # 
      # Provide the `session_duration_minutes` parameter to set the lifetime of the session. If the `session_duration_minutes` parameter is not specified, a Stytch session will be created with a duration of 60 minutes.
      # 
      # == Parameters:
      # organization_id::
      #   Globally unique UUID that identifies a specific Organization. The `organization_id` is critical to perform operations on an Organization, so be sure to preserve this value.
      #   The type of this field is +String+.
      # member_id::
      #   Globally unique UUID that identifies a specific Member. The `member_id` is critical to perform operations on a Member, so be sure to preserve this value.
      #   The type of this field is +String+.
      # code::
      #   The code to authenticate.
      #   The type of this field is +String+.
      # intermediate_session_token::
      #   The Intermediate Session Token. This token does not necessarily belong to a specific instance of a Member, but represents a bag of factors that may be converted to a member session.
      #     The token can be used with the [OTP SMS Authenticate endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-otp-sms) to complete an MFA flow;
      #     the [Exchange Intermediate Session endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/exchange-intermediate-session) to join a specific Organization that allows the factors represented by the intermediate session token;
      #     or the [Create Organization via Discovery endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/create-organization-via-discovery) to create a new Organization and Member.
      #   The type of this field is nilable +String+.
      # session_token::
      #   A secret token for a given Stytch Session.
      #   The type of this field is nilable +String+.
      # session_jwt::
      #   The JSON Web Token (JWT) for a given Stytch Session.
      #   The type of this field is nilable +String+.
      # session_duration_minutes::
      #   Set the session lifetime to be this many minutes from now. This will start a new session if one doesn't already exist, 
      #   returning both an opaque `session_token` and `session_jwt` for this session. Remember that the `session_jwt` will have a fixed lifetime of
      #   five minutes regardless of the underlying session duration, and will need to be refreshed over time.
      # 
      #   This value must be a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 527040 minutes (366 days).
      #   
      #   If a `session_token` or `session_jwt` is provided then a successful authentication will continue to extend the session this many minutes.
      #   
      #   If the `session_duration_minutes` parameter is not specified, a Stytch session will be created with a 60 minute duration. If you don't want
      #   to use the Stytch session product, you can ignore the session fields in the response.
      #   The type of this field is nilable +Integer+.
      # session_custom_claims::
      #   Add a custom claims map to the Session being authenticated. Claims are only created if a Session is initialized by providing a value in
      #   `session_duration_minutes`. Claims will be included on the Session object and in the JWT. To update a key in an existing Session, supply a new value. To
      #   delete a key, supply a null value. Custom claims made with reserved claims (`iss`, `sub`, `aud`, `exp`, `nbf`, `iat`, `jti`) will be ignored.
      #   Total custom claims size cannot exceed four kilobytes.
      #   The type of this field is nilable +object+.
      # set_mfa_enrollment::
      #   Optionally sets the Member’s MFA enrollment status upon a successful authentication. If the Organization’s MFA policy is `REQUIRED_FOR_ALL`, this field will be ignored. If this field is not passed in, the Member’s `mfa_enrolled` boolean will not be affected. The options are:
      #  
      #   `enroll` – sets the Member's `mfa_enrolled` boolean to `true`. The Member will be required to complete an MFA step upon subsequent logins to the Organization.
      #  
      #   `unenroll` –  sets the Member's `mfa_enrolled` boolean to `false`. The Member will no longer be required to complete MFA steps when logging in to the Organization.
      #   
      #   The type of this field is nilable +String+.
      # 
      # == Returns:
      # An object with the following fields:
      # request_id::
      #   Globally unique UUID that is returned with every API call. This value is important to log for debugging purposes; we may ask for this value to help identify a specific API call when helping you debug an issue.
      #   The type of this field is +String+.
      # member_id::
      #   Globally unique UUID that identifies a specific Member.
      #   The type of this field is +String+.
      # member::
      #   The [Member object](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/member-object)
      #   The type of this field is +Member+ (+object+).
      # organization::
      #   The [Organization object](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/organization-object).
      #   The type of this field is +Organization+ (+object+).
      # session_token::
      #   A secret token for a given Stytch Session.
      #   The type of this field is +String+.
      # session_jwt::
      #   The JSON Web Token (JWT) for a given Stytch Session.
      #   The type of this field is +String+.
      # status_code::
      #   The HTTP status code of the response. Stytch follows standard HTTP response status code patterns, e.g. 2XX values equate to success, 3XX values are redirects, 4XX are client errors, and 5XX are server errors.
      #   The type of this field is +Integer+.
