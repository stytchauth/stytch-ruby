      # Send a One-Time Passcode (OTP) to a Member's phone number.
      #
      # If the Member already has a phone number, the `mfa_phone_number` field is not needed; the endpoint will send an OTP to the number associated with the Member.
      # If the Member does not have a phone number, the endpoint will send an OTP to the `mfa_phone_number` provided and link the `mfa_phone_number` with the Member.
      #
      # An error will be thrown if the Member already has a phone number and the provided `mfa_phone_number` does not match the existing one.
      #
      # OTP codes expire after two minutes. Note that sending another OTP code before the first has expired will invalidate the first code.
      #
      # If a Member has a phone number and is enrolled in MFA, then after a successful primary authentication event (e.g. [email magic link](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-magic-link) or [SSO](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/sso-authenticate) login is complete), an SMS OTP will automatically be sent to their phone number. In that case, this endpoint should only be used for subsequent authentication events, such as prompting a Member for an OTP again after a period of inactivity.
      #
      # If the Member already has an active MFA factor, then passing an intermediate session token, session token, or session JWT with the existing MFA factor on it is required to prevent bypassing MFA.
      #
      # Otherwise, passing an intermediate session token, session token, or session JWT is not required, but if passed must match the `member_id` passed.
      #
      # ### Cost to send SMS OTP
      # Before configuring SMS or WhatsApp OTPs, please review how Stytch [bills the costs of international OTPs](https://stytch.com/pricing) and understand how to protect your app against [toll fraud](https://stytch.com/docs/guides/passcodes/toll-fraud/overview).
      #
      # Even when international SMS is enabled, we do not support sending SMS to countries on our [Unsupported countries list](https://stytch.com/docs/guides/passcodes/unsupported-countries).
      #
      # __Note:__ SMS to phone numbers outside of the US and Canada is disabled by default for customers who did not use SMS prior to October 2023. If you're interested in sending international SMS, please add those countries to your Project's allowlist via the [Dashboard](https://stytch.com/dashboard/country-code-allowlists) or [Programmatic Workspace Actions](https://stytch.com/docs/workspace-management/pwa/set-allowed-country-codes), and [add credit card details](https://stytch.com/dashboard/settings/billing) to your account.

      # == Parameters:
      # organization_id::
      #   Globally unique UUID that identifies a specific Organization. The `organization_id` is critical to perform operations on an Organization, so be sure to preserve this value. You may also use the organization_slug or organization_external_id here as a convenience.
      #   The type of this field is +String+.
      # member_id::
      #   Globally unique UUID that identifies a specific Member. The `member_id` is critical to perform operations on a Member, so be sure to preserve this value. You may use an external_id here if one is set for the member.
      #   The type of this field is +String+.
      # mfa_phone_number::
      #   The phone number to send the OTP to. If the Member already has a phone number, this argument is not needed.
      #   The type of this field is nilable +String+.

      # SMS OTPs may not be used as a primary authentication mechanism. They can be used to complete an MFA requirement, or they can be used as a step-up factor to be added to an existing session.
      #
      # This endpoint verifies that the one-time passcode (OTP) is valid and hasn't expired or been previously used. OTP codes expire after two minutes.
      #
      # A given Member may only have a single active OTP code at any given time. If a Member requests another OTP code before the first one has expired, the first one will be invalidated.
      #
      # Exactly one of `intermediate_session_token`, `session_token`, or `session_jwt` must be provided in the request.
      # If an intermediate session token is provided, this operation will consume it.
      #
      # Intermediate session tokens are generated upon successful calls to primary authenticate methods in the case where MFA is required,
      # such as [email magic link authenticate](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-magic-link),
      # or upon successful calls to discovery authenticate methods, such as [email magic link discovery authenticate](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-discovery-magic-link).
      #
      # If the Organization's MFA policy is `REQUIRED_FOR_ALL`, a successful OTP authentication will change the Member's `mfa_enrolled` status to `true` if it is not already `true`.
      # If the Organization's MFA policy is `OPTIONAL`, the Member's MFA enrollment can be toggled by passing in a value for the `set_mfa_enrollment` field.
      # The Member's MFA enrollment can also be toggled through the [Update Member](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/update-member) endpoint.
      #
      # Provide the `session_duration_minutes` parameter to set the lifetime of the session. If the `session_duration_minutes` parameter is not specified, a Stytch session will be created with a duration of 60 minutes.

      # intermediate_session_token::
      #   The Intermediate Session Token. This token does not necessarily belong to a specific instance of a Member, but represents a bag of factors that may be converted to a member session. The token can be used with the [OTP SMS Authenticate endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-otp-sms), [TOTP Authenticate endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-totp), or [Recovery Codes Recover endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/recovery-codes-recover) to complete an MFA flow and log in to the Organization.

      # session_jwt::
      #   The JSON Web Token (JWT) for a given Stytch Session.
      #   The type of this field is nilable +String+.
      # session_duration_minutes::
      #   Set the session lifetime to be this many minutes from now. This will start a new session if one doesn't already exist,
      #   returning both an opaque `session_token` and `session_jwt` for this session. Remember that the `session_jwt` will have a fixed lifetime of
      #   five minutes regardless of the underlying session duration, and will need to be refreshed over time.
      #
      #   This value must be a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 527040 minutes (366 days).
      #
      #   If a `session_token` or `session_jwt` is provided then a successful authentication will continue to extend the session this many minutes.
      #
      #   If the `session_duration_minutes` parameter is not specified, a Stytch session will be created with a 60 minute duration. If you don't want
      #   to use the Stytch session product, you can ignore the session fields in the response.
      #   The type of this field is nilable +Integer+.
      # session_custom_claims::
      #   Add a custom claims map to the Session being authenticated. Claims are only created if a Session is initialized by providing a value in
      #   `session_duration_minutes`. Claims will be included on the Session object and in the JWT. To update a key in an existing Session, supply a new value. To
      #   delete a key, supply a null value. Custom claims made with reserved claims (`iss`, `sub`, `aud`, `exp`, `nbf`, `iat`, `jti`) will be ignored.
      #   Total custom claims size cannot exceed four kilobytes.
      #   The type of this field is nilable +object+.
      # set_mfa_enrollment::
      #   Optionally sets the Member’s MFA enrollment status upon a successful authentication. If the Organization’s MFA policy is `REQUIRED_FOR_ALL`, this field will be ignored. If this field is not passed in, the Member’s `mfa_enrolled` boolean will not be affected. The options are:
      #
      #   `enroll` – sets the Member's `mfa_enrolled` boolean to `true`. The Member will be required to complete an MFA step upon subsequent logins to the Organization.
      #
      #   `unenroll` –  sets the Member's `mfa_enrolled` boolean to `false`. The Member will no longer be required to complete MFA steps when logging in to the Organization.
      #
      #   The type of this field is nilable +String+.

      #   Globally unique UUID that identifies a specific Organization. The `organization_id` is critical to perform operations on an Organization, so be sure to preserve this value. You may also use the organization_slug or organization_external_id here as a convenience.
      #   The type of this field is +String+.
      # email_address::
      #   The email address of the Member.
      #   The type of this field is +String+.
      # code::
      #   The code to authenticate.
      #   The type of this field is +String+.
      # session_token::
      #   A secret token for a given Stytch Session.
      #   The type of this field is nilable +String+.
      # session_jwt::
      #   The JSON Web Token (JWT) for a given Stytch Session.
      #   The type of this field is nilable +String+.
      # intermediate_session_token::
      #   The Intermediate Session Token. This token does not necessarily belong to a specific instance of a Member, but represents a bag of factors that may be converted to a member session. The token can be used with the [OTP SMS Authenticate endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-otp-sms), [TOTP Authenticate endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-totp), or [Recovery Codes Recover endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/recovery-codes-recover) to complete an MFA flow and log in to the Organization. The token has a default expiry of 10 minutes. It can also be used with the [Exchange Intermediate Session endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/exchange-intermediate-session) to join a specific Organization that allows the factors represented by the intermediate session token; or the [Create Organization via Discovery endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/create-organization-via-discovery) to create a new Organization and Member. Intermediate Session Tokens have a default expiry of 10 minutes.
      #   The type of this field is nilable +String+.
      # session_duration_minutes::
      #   Set the session lifetime to be this many minutes from now. This will start a new session if one doesn't already exist,
      #   returning both an opaque `session_token` and `session_jwt` for this session. Remember that the `session_jwt` will have a fixed lifetime of
      #   five minutes regardless of the underlying session duration, and will need to be refreshed over time.
      #
      #   This value must be a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 527040 minutes (366 days).
      #
      #   If a `session_token` or `session_jwt` is provided then a successful authentication will continue to extend the session this many minutes.
      #
      #   If the `session_duration_minutes` parameter is not specified, a Stytch session will be created with a 60 minute duration. If you don't want
      #   to use the Stytch session product, you can ignore the session fields in the response.
      #   The type of this field is nilable +Integer+.
      # session_custom_claims::
      #   Add a custom claims map to the Session being authenticated. Claims are only created if a Session is initialized by providing a value in
      #   `session_duration_minutes`. Claims will be included on the Session object and in the JWT. To update a key in an existing Session, supply a new value. To
      #   delete a key, supply a null value. Custom claims made with reserved claims (`iss`, `sub`, `aud`, `exp`, `nbf`, `iat`, `jti`) will be ignored.
      #   Total custom claims size cannot exceed four kilobytes.
      #   The type of this field is nilable +object+.
      # locale::
      #   Used to determine which language to use when sending the user this delivery method. Parameter is a [IETF BCP 47 language tag](https://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/), e.g. `"en"`.
      #
      # Currently supported languages are English (`"en"`), Spanish (`"es"`), French (`"fr"`) and Brazilian Portuguese (`"pt-br"`); if no value is provided, the copy defaults to English.
      #
