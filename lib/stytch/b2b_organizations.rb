    # Our RBAC implementation offers out-of-the-box handling of authorization checks for this endpoint. If you pass in
    # a header containing a `session_token` or a `session_jwt` for an unexpired Member Session, we will check that the
    # Member Session has the necessary permissions. The specific permissions needed depend on which of the optional fields
    # are passed in the request. For example, if the `organization_name` argument is provided, the Member Session must have
    # permission to perform the `update.info.name` action on the `stytch.organization` Resource.
    #
    # If the Member Session does not contain a Role that satisfies the requested permissions, or if the Member's Organization
    # does not match the `organization_id` passed in the request, a 403 error will be thrown. Otherwise, the request will
    # proceed as normal.

    # Search for Organizations. If you send a request with no body params, no filtering will be applied and the endpoint will return all Organizations. All fuzzy search filters require a minimum of three characters.
    #
    # == Parameters:
    # cursor::
    #   The `cursor` field allows you to paginate through your results. Each result array is limited to 1000 results. If your query returns more than 1000 results, you will need to paginate the responses using the `cursor`. If you receive a response that includes a non-null `next_cursor` in the `results_metadata` object, repeat the search call with the `next_cursor` value set to the `cursor` field to retrieve the next page of results. Continue to make search calls until the `next_cursor` in the response is null.
    #   The type of this field is nilable +String+.
    # limit::
    #   The number of search results to return per page. The default limit is 100. A maximum of 1000 results can be returned by a single search request. If the total size of your result set is greater than one page size, you must paginate the response. See the `cursor` field.
    #   The type of this field is nilable +Integer+.
    # query::
    #   The optional query object contains the operator, i.e. `AND` or `OR`, and the operands that will filter your results. Only an operator is required. If you include no operands, no filtering will be applied. If you include no query object, it will return all Organizations with no filtering applied.
    #   The type of this field is nilable +SearchQuery+ (+object+).
    #
    # == Returns:
    # An object with the following fields:
    # request_id::
    #   Globally unique UUID that is returned with every API call. This value is important to log for debugging purposes; we may ask for this value to help identify a specific API call when helping you debug an issue.
    #   The type of this field is +String+.
    # organizations::
    #   An array of [Organization objects](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/organization-object).
    #   The type of this field is list of +Organization+ (+object+).
    # results_metadata::
    #   The search `results_metadata` object contains metadata relevant to your specific query like `total` and `next_cursor`.
    #   The type of this field is +ResultsMetadata+ (+object+).
    # status_code::
    #   The HTTP status code of the response. Stytch follows standard HTTP response status code patterns, e.g. 2XX values equate to success, 3XX values are redirects, 4XX are client errors, and 5XX are server errors.

      # Updates a Member specified by `organization_id` and `member_id`.
      #
      # Our RBAC implementation offers out-of-the-box handling of authorization checks for this endpoint. If you pass in
      # a header containing a `session_token` or a `session_jwt` for an unexpired Member Session, we will check that the
      # Member Session has the necessary permissions. The specific permissions needed depend on which of the optional fields
      # are passed in the request. For example, if the `organization_name` argument is provided, the Member Session must have
      # permission to perform the `update.info.name` action on the `stytch.organization` Resource.
      #
      # If the Member Session does not contain a Role that satisfies the requested permissions, or if the Member's Organization
      # does not match the `organization_id` passed in the request, a 403 error will be thrown. Otherwise, the request will
      # proceed as normal.
      #
      # To learn more about our RBAC implementation, see our [RBAC guide](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/guides/rbac/overview).
      #
      # == Parameters:
      # organization_id::
      #   Globally unique UUID that identifies a specific Organization. The `organization_id` is critical to perform operations on an Organization, so be sure to preserve this value.
      #   The type of this field is +String+.
      # member_id::
      #   Globally unique UUID that identifies a specific Member. The `member_id` is critical to perform operations on a Member, so be sure to preserve this value.
      #   The type of this field is +String+.
      # name::
      #   The name of the Member.
      #
      # If this field is provided and a session header is passed into the request, the Member Session must have permission to perform the `update.info.name` action on the `stytch.member` Resource.
      #   Alternatively, if the Member Session matches the Member associated with the `member_id` passed in the request, the authorization check will also allow a Member Session that has permission to perform the `update.info.name` action on the `stytch.self` Resource.
      #   The type of this field is nilable +String+.
      # trusted_metadata::
      #   An arbitrary JSON object for storing application-specific data or identity-provider-specific data.
      #           If a session header is passed into the request, this field may **not** be passed into the request. You cannot
      #           update trusted metadata when acting as a Member.
      #   The type of this field is nilable +object+.
      # untrusted_metadata::
      #   An arbitrary JSON object of application-specific data. These fields can be edited directly by the
      #   frontend SDK, and should not be used to store critical information. See the [Metadata resource](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/metadata)
      #   for complete field behavior details.
      #
      # If this field is provided and a session header is passed into the request, the Member Session must have permission to perform the `update.info.untrusted-metadata` action on the `stytch.member` Resource.
      #   Alternatively, if the Member Session matches the Member associated with the `member_id` passed in the request, the authorization check will also allow a Member Session that has permission to perform the `update.info.untrusted-metadata` action on the `stytch.self` Resource.
      #   The type of this field is nilable +object+.
      # is_breakglass::
      #   Identifies the Member as a break glass user - someone who has permissions to authenticate into an Organization by bypassing the Organization's settings. A break glass account is typically used for emergency purposes to gain access outside of normal authentication procedures. Refer to the [Organization object](organization-object) and its `auth_methods` and `allowed_auth_methods` fields for more details.
      #
      # If this field is provided and a session header is passed into the request, the Member Session must have permission to perform the `update.info.is-breakglass` action on the `stytch.member` Resource.
      #   The type of this field is nilable +Boolean+.
      # mfa_phone_number::
      #   Sets the Member's phone number. Throws an error if the Member already has a phone number. To change the Member's phone number, use the [Delete member phone number endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/delete-member-mfa-phone-number) to delete the Member's existing phone number first.
      #
      # If this field is provided and a session header is passed into the request, the Member Session must have permission to perform the `update.info.mfa-phone` action on the `stytch.member` Resource.
      #   Alternatively, if the Member Session matches the Member associated with the `member_id` passed in the request, the authorization check will also allow a Member Session that has permission to perform the `update.info.mfa-phone` action on the `stytch.self` Resource.
      #   The type of this field is nilable +String+.
      # mfa_enrolled::
      #   Sets whether the Member is enrolled in MFA. If true, the Member must complete an MFA step whenever they wish to log in to their Organization. If false, the Member only needs to complete an MFA step if the Organization's MFA policy is set to `REQUIRED_FOR_ALL`.
      #
      # If this field is provided and a session header is passed into the request, the Member Session must have permission to perform the `update.settings.mfa-enrolled` action on the `stytch.member` Resource.
      #   Alternatively, if the Member Session matches the Member associated with the `member_id` passed in the request, the authorization check will also allow a Member Session that has permission to perform the `update.settings.mfa-enrolled` action on the `stytch.self` Resource.
      #   The type of this field is nilable +Boolean+.
      # roles::
      #   Roles to explicitly assign to this Member.
      #  Will completely replace any existing explicitly assigned roles. See the
      #  [RBAC guide](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/guides/rbac/role-assignment) for more information about role assignment.
      #
      #    If a Role is removed from a Member, and the Member is also implicitly assigned this Role from an SSO connection
      #    or an SSO group, we will by default revoke any existing sessions for the Member that contain any SSO
      #    authentication factors with the affected connection ID. You can preserve these sessions by passing in the
      #    `preserve_existing_sessions` parameter with a value of `true`.
      #
      # If this field is provided and a session header is passed into the request, the Member Session must have permission to perform the `update.settings.roles` action on the `stytch.member` Resource.
      #   The type of this field is nilable list of +String+.
      # preserve_existing_sessions::
      #   Whether to preserve existing sessions when explicit Roles that are revoked are also implicitly assigned
      #   by SSO connection or SSO group. Defaults to `false` - that is, existing Member Sessions that contain SSO
      #   authentication factors with the affected SSO connection IDs will be revoked.
      #   The type of this field is nilable +Boolean+.
      # default_mfa_method::
      #   The Member's default MFA method. This value is used to determine which secondary MFA method to use in the case of multiple methods registered for a Member. The current possible values are `sms_otp` and `totp`.
      #   The type of this field is nilable +String+.
      #
      # == Returns:
      # An object with the following fields:
